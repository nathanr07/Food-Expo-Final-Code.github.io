                <h2>Eye Fillet and Caramelised Onion Cracker</h2>
                <p>Throughout this unit we have been testing and trialling properties of ingredients and learning about incorporating indigenous ingredients into many dishes. This lead to my development of my dish – eye fillet and caramelized onion cracker. I have changed and developed the structure of the crackers using different flours and decided on using whole meal flour for this dish. I have also incorporated manuka honey into the canape as my indigenous ingredient, in the caramelized honey and mascarpone. </p>

                <p>he dish that i have made is Bruschetta with Kawakawa crostini. We had to use an indigenous ingredient from New Zealand.
